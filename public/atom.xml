    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most developers don&#8217;t need an explanation of what a &#8220;* Smell&#8221; refers to, but I&#8217;m
assuming that the companies that fit the description of this post won&#8217;t
(incidentally, those companies probably wouldn&#8217;t read this blog post either). A
&#8220;code smell&#8221; is an indication, a symptom, within a codebase, of a problem.</p>

<p>A company smell is an indication of a larger problem in an organization.</p>

<p>When a company uses a service for sourcing developers in today&#8217;s crazy world
that opens with the following epic line:</p>

<blockquote><h4>What we do&#8230;</h4>

<p>We&#8217;re a new style of recruiting service that charges by the hour
for our time.</p></blockquote>

<p>As a developer/hacker/überninja/engineering-talent all I see is a giant red
flag. These are not recruiters that will try to get to understand the
requirements of the position they are trying to fill, nor will they try to
understand how I, as a human being, can contribute (or detract) in that
position. Quite the opposite, the incentive is in delivering a result quickly.
Any result. Quickly. Time is money. And all ruby on rails ninjas are made equal.</p>

<p>The homepage of &#8220;theSourcery&#8221; goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re re-inventing the way recruiting is done by changing the incentive
structure for recruiters and leveraging data and software while keeping our
work human powered and personal.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ll (fail at trying to) overlook the obvious fact that there is no explanation
of what this likely earth-shattering re-invention of the way recruitment is
conducted in their site, I&#8217;ll just point out how I must be missing something
huge by the fact that one sentence before that they were mentioning how they are
hunting for developers on an hourly rate and later on go on to say that you are
keeping things personal.</p>

<p>It seems that some companies don&#8217;t get what being on the receiving end of these
type of recruiters is like. The fact that they are charging by the hour
incentivizes all the wrong aspects of recruitment while completely undermining
the positive (and often under appreciated by developers, specially in the HN
crowd).</p>

<p>The company itself seems mildly interesting (sorry for falling into the <em>prima
donna</em> cliché). I&#8217;m a bit surprised that they are replicating a feature
currently existent in iOS&#8217;s Passbook, yet they don&#8217;t mention it. If I was
writing the job spec I would include the differentiator factor within the first
paragraph; joining a startup (again, specially on this market) requires not only
a good position with fair compensation, but, at least to me, believing in what
the company&#8217;s outcome and impact will be is extremely important. A lot of us
work for &#8220;free&#8221; on things when we believe in them enough.</p>

<p>The fact that this particular company will try to hire from a pool of recruiters
that will end up being incentives to spam that hell out of every email address
they get their hands on, is a very powerful company smell: they don&#8217;t care about
the practices of people they work with, and they&#8217;ll likely won&#8217;t care about the
type of developers they find.</p>

<p>No, I&#8217;m not replying to your (absolutely decontextualized) email, Angelina.
Sorry.</p>

    <updated>2010-06-23T23:10:00-03:00</updated>
    <id>http://heelhook.github.com/blog/2010/06/23/acts-as-authentic-nightmare</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I decided to do a few tests on the Server Protectors’ website and noticed a few annoyances with the register form, I decided to delve in and fix it, just a couple of extra validations, not too much.</p>

<p>Half an hour later I was pretty much ready to do some open heart surgery on authlogic, man is the configuration of act_as_authentic confusing! And of course, RTFMing doesn’t work, there is not a single example of how changing the default act_as_authentic configuration works!</p>

<p>Searching around I found a few persons with the same problem and no solutions, so I thought I should share how I did it, or rather, what I did.</p>

<p>This is the resulting code:</p>

<p>acts_as_authentic do |c|
 c.validates_uniqueness_of_email_field_options = {:if => &#8220;false&#8221;}
 c.validates_length_of_login_field_options = {:if => &#8220;false&#8221;, :minimum => 4}
 c.validates_format_of_login_field_options = {:if => &#8220;false&#8221;, :with => Authlogic::Regex.login}
 c.validates_length_of_email_field_options = {:if => &#8220;false&#8221;, :minimum => 4}
 c.validates_confirmation_of_password_field_options = {:if => &#8220;false&#8221;}
 c.validates_length_of_password_confirmation_field_options = {:if => &#8220;false&#8221;, :minimum => 4 }
end
So as you can see a couple of options are a bit lame, like having a minimum when the if is being set to false, well, if you remove the minumum validates_length_of will complain (it makes sense from validates_length_of point of view, after all, if you are never going to be using the validation why call the function at all?)</p>

<p>I hope this helps and saves some time.</p>

    <id>http://heelhook.github.com/blog/2010/05/11/xbmc-issues-with-smb</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been having issues with XBMC playing files served through samba, I don’t recall when this started, but for sometime I couldn’t even browse the collection of files in my own server. Nothing changed, well, I did upgrade Ubuntu to 10.04 on my server, but I think this was happening before that.</p>

<p>Anyway, I browsed the internet and didn’t find anything related to this error or how to fix it.</p>

<p>After looking around in the configuration I’ve found something which caught my eye and I got it working.</p>

<p>The error I was getting was:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>23:09:42 T:3077850992 M:1831804928   ERROR: SMBDirectory-&gt;GetDirectory: Unable to open directory : 'smb://'

<p>And what I had to do is remove the XML path in <code>$HOME/.xbmc/userdata/guisettings.xml</code> that started with the tag <code>&lt;smb&gt;</code>. Removed that, restarted XBMC and things started to work again.</p>

    <id>http://heelhook.github.com/blog/2010/03/06/a-brave-new-media-center-revisited</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently wrote a post about my new media center, running off my laptop, well, while that setup was sweet and all, there was some sort of hole in it, that is, my laptop went belly up…</p>

<p>That was quite unfortunate, but it gave me the possibility to play with some new stuff, namely ITX setups.</p>

<p>I have finished yesterday building my ITX box, an Intel D510mo with an Atom D510 processor (dual with hyperthreading so 4 threads), 2 GB of RAM at 800 Mhz, WiFi PCI card on a Vitsuba Blackbox case, with a generic DVD-RW.</p>

<p>The setup is very sweet, I had lots of troubles building the system, at one point I thought my motherboard was faulty and I had to take it back to the store, but it seems the motherboard was ok, it was simply a matter of the mother producing a short while sitting in the case because of a mislocated screw in the case.</p>

<p>After the case was done I proceeded to install Ubuntu Karmic 9.10, to my surprise I had lots of troubles installing it, I had to perform the installation booting the netinstall through PXE (since I was out of CDs and all stores were closed). Once I was able to install Ubuntu I found that Ubuntu didn’t support the video card in the motherboard, and during the boot sequence the screen would go blank and there was pretty much nothing I could do about it.</p>

<p>Googling around I found other users with the same problem and determined to go with the same solution others had used… saying goodbye to Ubuntu and the beautiful Debian and APT world and totally selling out to the Fedora and Red Hat town (notice my strong bias :p).</p>

<p>I went through the horrible Fedora installation experience which is like getting hit on the ballsack while driving on a bike with no seat, configured GDM to autostart (which amazingly is not supported through gdm-config) and then I proceeded to build XBMC (since there is no XBMC build for non debian distributions (well done, and no, I’m not being ironic)).</p>

<p>It turns out building something like XBMC with support for many different codecs is not as straightforward as imaginable, who would have thought?! (now I am being ironic).</p>

<p>Here are some tips for others:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add extra repositories (Fedora sucks)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the <code>make -j 4</code> command might succeed but not finish, I have found a few times that when using make in parallel even with multiple cores it will skip files, you want to use <code>make -j 4</code> a few times to accelerate the process but do make sure its actually finished running make.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have recently come across this eye opening post. I mean, it probably was eye opening back when it was written in 1995, heck, I bet most Newsweek readers back then yelled something like “I knew it, that Internet thing is bullcrap!”.</p>

<p>This article, astonishingly titled <a href="http://threewordchant.com/2010/02/24/why-the-internet-will-fail-from-1995/">Why the internet will fail</a>, runs down through the many reasons why Internet would be something we would all get over soon really quickly, like we did with Tamagotchis (thankfully).</p>

<p>Now, this is not your run of the mill ignorant news reporter who talks about things s/he doesn’t understand, this was written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Stoll">Clifford Stoll</a>, an astronomer and technology writer, working out of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Yet, he can be quoted saying</p>

<blockquote><p>Yet Nicholas Negroponte, director of the MIT Media Lab, predicts that we’ll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Intenet. Uh, sure.</p></blockquote>

<p>This author was an authority, someone that we could think that knows much more than we do, so if we disagree with his view we might want to review our opinion.</p>

<p>And this is something that I have seen over and over again, the number of specialists, analysts, etcists, that express an opinion on their field and its completely wrong, completely off base. Of course, we are all humans, we tend to make mistakes, so don’t take this as being judgmental, I’m just saying, we should listen, but we should selectively listen and always make up our own mind and not act on other’s opinions but our own.</p>

    <updated>2010-02-23T23:08:00-03:00</updated>
    <id>http://heelhook.github.com/blog/2010/02/23/the-value-of-idle-time</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have recently read a quote attributed to Einstein, it reads something along the lines of “the best ideas I have I have them while I shave”. This got me thinking, how much idle time do I have on any given month?</p>

<p>I am an Internet junky, and completely obsessed with efficiency, so I may not be a good statistical sample, but bear with me on this one.</p>

<p>Aftter considering the different idle times we get throughout our daily lives, commuting, personal care time, all meals, I have realized that most of those times I have occupied them (except commute since I work out of my home office) with some supposedly time saving activity, whether it is checking my email, browsing, reading blogs, even when I shower I have managed to be able to do “something”, even if it is just listening to music (come to think about it maybe I could tune some podcasts).</p>

<p>It feels like I’m constantly multitasking, maybe this is a good thing, or maybe not. Even now, I am on my way to a medical check up writing this post on my iPhone.</p>

<p>This forces me to ask myself “What’s the value of idle time?”. For some reason it feels like my ideas begin to flow so much better when I’m not doing something else, when I’m only commuting. It would seem like our information overload and constantly-online capabilities on our smartphones, our inclination to be constatly productive has actually defeated it’s own purpose messing with our creativity.</p>

<p>Listening to other people’s ideas requires not listening to ours, at least for a brief moment. You can use others’ ideas as a trigger for inspiration but at one point the marginal value of listening becomes detrimental to our own creativity and innovation. In the very same way that this happens with consumers indifference curves this can’t be quantifies nor generalized as more people require more listening and some people require less listening.</p>

<p>Ok enough about this, I’m going to continue reading on my kindle now.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have recently had the opportunity to help out a friend who is launching her own company. This is the first time I have informally gave advice to a fellow entrepreneur and I have found it to be a very rich experience, where a lot of value is easily created, strengthening the “core friendship” in the process.</p>

<p>From a purely selfish point of view I have been enjoying myself, opening up to a new industry I haven’t gave too much thought ever before, and sharing ideas on the go. I have seen this before, but being the reminded of the richness of bouncing ideas off someones head and seeing what comes back at you is always a good and enjoyable thing.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I wish her the best of lucks in her new endeavor! Best of lucks, Lucila!</p>
