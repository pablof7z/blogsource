    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have recently had the opportunity to help out a friend who is launching her own company. This is the first time I have informally gave advice to a fellow entrepreneur and I have found it to be a very rich experience, where a lot of value is easily created, strengthening the “core friendship” in the process.</p>

<p>From a purely selfish point of view I have been enjoying myself, opening up to a new industry I haven’t gave too much thought ever before, and sharing ideas on the go. I have seen this before, but being the reminded of the richness of bouncing ideas off someones head and seeing what comes back at you is always a good and enjoyable thing.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I wish her the best of lucks in her new endeavor! Best of lucks, Lucila!</p>
