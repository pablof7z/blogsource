    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I decided to do a few tests on the Server Protectors’ website and noticed a few annoyances with the register form, I decided to delve in and fix it, just a couple of extra validations, not too much.</p>

<p>Half an hour later I was pretty much ready to do some open heart surgery on authlogic, man is the configuration of act_as_authentic confusing! And of course, RTFMing doesn’t work, there is not a single example of how changing the default act_as_authentic configuration works!</p>

<p>Searching around I found a few persons with the same problem and no solutions, so I thought I should share how I did it, or rather, what I did.</p>

<p>This is the resulting code:</p>

<p>acts_as_authentic do |c|
 c.validates_uniqueness_of_email_field_options = {:if => "false"}
 c.validates_length_of_login_field_options = {:if => "false", :minimum => 4}
 c.validates_format_of_login_field_options = {:if => "false", :with => Authlogic::Regex.login}
 c.validates_length_of_email_field_options = {:if => "false", :minimum => 4}
 c.validates_confirmation_of_password_field_options = {:if => "false"}
 c.validates_length_of_password_confirmation_field_options = {:if => "false", :minimum => 4 }
end
So as you can see a couple of options are a bit lame, like having a minimum when the if is being set to false, well, if you remove the minumum validates_length_of will complain (it makes sense from validates_length_of point of view, after all, if you are never going to be using the validation why call the function at all?)</p>

<p>I hope this helps and saves some time.</p>
